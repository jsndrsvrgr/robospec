Analyze the following robot learning task description and extract a structured specification.

VALID CATEGORIES (pick exactly one):
- manipulation_reach: Robot arm reaching or tracking target positions → Robot: franka_panda
- classic_cartpole: Cart-pole balancing or swing-up tasks → Robot: cartpole
- locomotion_flat: Quadruped walking on flat ground → Robot: anymal_d
- locomotion_rough: Quadruped walking on rough/uneven terrain → Robot: anymal_d

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Pick the category that best matches the description
2. Extract what the robot should achieve (objectives)
3. Extract what should be penalized or avoided (constraints)
4. If the description doesn't specify constraints, infer reasonable defaults
5. Set difficulty: "easy" for simple tasks, "medium" for standard, "hard" for complex

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. No markdown fences. No explanation. No text before or after the JSON.
