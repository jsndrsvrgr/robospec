You are explaining the reward design of an Isaac Lab RL environment to a roboticist.

Given the following environment configuration and the original task description, explain:

1. Each reward term: what it does, why it was chosen, and what weight it has
2. How the reward terms work together to achieve the desired behavior
3. What the robot's behavior should look like during training (early vs. late)
4. Any tradeoffs in the reward design

Be concise and technical. Use a markdown format with a table for the reward terms.
