Generate a complete, runnable Isaac Lab environment configuration for the following task.

STRICT RULES:
1. Output ONLY valid Python code in the specified file format below
2. Follow the @configclass pattern EXACTLY as shown in the example configurations in your context
3. ONLY use reward functions, observation functions, termination functions, and event functions listed in the APPROVED FUNCTIONS section below
4. ONLY use robots that appear in the Robot Specifications in your context
5. Reward weights: positive for objectives, negative for penalties
6. You MUST include all required config classes: SceneCfg, ObservationsCfg, ActionsCfg, RewardsCfg, TerminationsCfg, EventCfg
7. You MUST include a __post_init__ method that sets decimation, episode_length_s, and sim.dt
8. The environment class MUST inherit from ManagerBasedRLEnvCfg
9. Do NOT use any functions, classes, or imports that don't exist in Isaac Lab
10. Do NOT invent or hallucinate MDP function names — only use the exact names listed below

ROBOT CONFIGURATION RULES (CRITICAL — violating these will cause runtime crashes):
- NEVER define robot ArticulationCfg inline with USD paths or spawn configs
- ALWAYS import the pre-built robot config and use .replace():
  - Cartpole: from isaaclab_assets.robots.cartpole import CARTPOLE_CFG
    robot: ArticulationCfg = CARTPOLE_CFG.replace(prim_path="{{ENV_REGEX_NS}}/Robot")
  - Franka:  from isaaclab_assets.robots.franka import FRANKA_PANDA_HIGH_PD_CFG
    robot: ArticulationCfg = FRANKA_PANDA_HIGH_PD_CFG.replace(prim_path="{{ENV_REGEX_NS}}/Robot")
  - ANYmal-D: from isaaclab_assets.robots.anymal import ANYMAL_D_CFG
    robot: ArticulationCfg = ANYMAL_D_CFG.replace(prim_path="{{ENV_REGEX_NS}}/Robot")
- NEVER use literal "ISAACLAB_NUCLEUS_DIR/..." strings for robot paths
- Use 'import isaaclab.envs.mdp as mdp' — NOT task-specific mdp imports

COMMAND CONFIGURATION RULES:
- For locomotion tasks: include a CommandsCfg class with mdp.UniformVelocityCommandCfg
- For manipulation/reach tasks: include a CommandsCfg class with mdp.UniformPoseCommandCfg
- For cartpole/classic tasks: do NOT include a CommandsCfg class (no commands needed)
- Command configs are accessed as mdp.UniformVelocityCommandCfg(...), not as a separate import
- See the example configurations in your context for the exact pattern

EPISODE LENGTH GUIDELINES:
- Cartpole / classic control: episode_length_s = 5.0
- Manipulation / reach: episode_length_s = 5.0 to 12.0
- Locomotion flat: episode_length_s = 20.0
- Locomotion rough: episode_length_s = 20.0
- Never exceed 20.0 unless the user explicitly requests longer episodes

TASK SPECIFICATION:
- Category: {category}
- Robot: {robot}
- Objectives: {objectives}
- Constraints: {constraints}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Episode Length: {episode_length_s}s
- Num Environments: {num_envs}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output ONLY the env_cfg.py file using the ### FILE: marker below. Do NOT output __init__.py or train.sh — those will be generated automatically.
